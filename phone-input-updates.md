# Phone Input Styling Updates

## What I've implemented:

### âœ… **Phone Input Component**
- Created a custom `PhoneInput` component that wraps `react-phone-number-input`
- Fully matches your existing design system (shadcn/ui styling)
- Includes country code picker with flag icons
- Auto-formats phone numbers as you type
- Validates phone numbers before form submission

### âœ… **Features Added**
1. **Country Code Picker**: Users can select from any country
2. **Auto-Formatting**: Phone numbers are automatically formatted (e.g., +1 (555) 123-4567)
3. **Validation**: Uses `libphonenumber-js` to validate phone numbers
4. **Error Handling**: Shows validation errors in red
5. **Accessibility**: Proper labels and ARIA attributes
6. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

### âœ… **Integration**
- Updated **signup page** to use the new PhoneInput
- Updated **complete-profile page** to use the new PhoneInput
- Added phone number validation to both forms
- Maintains all existing functionality

### ðŸŽ¨ **Styling**
- **Consistent**: Matches your existing Input components exactly
- **Professional**: Clean, modern appearance with proper spacing
- **Interactive**: Hover and focus states for better UX
- **Error States**: Red border and text for validation errors
- **Flag Icons**: Small, crisp country flags with proper borders

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**
- Uses `react-phone-number-input` for functionality
- Uses `libphonenumber-js` for validation
- Integrates with your existing form validation
- CSS styling in globals.css for consistent theming
- TypeScript support with proper types

## How it works:

1. **Signup Flow**: 
   - User enters phone number with country code picker
   - Number is automatically formatted as they type
   - Validation occurs on form submission
   - Invalid numbers show error message

2. **Complete Profile Flow**:
   - Same functionality as signup
   - Phone number is required for Google sign-up users
   - Validation ensures only valid numbers are saved

The styling is clean, professional, and consistent with your existing design system. The country selector is positioned perfectly within the input field, and the formatting happens automatically as users type.
